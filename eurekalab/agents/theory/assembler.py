"""Assembler — Stage 5 of the bottom-up proof pipeline.

Takes all proven lemmas (newly proved + citation-only known results)
and weaves them into a single coherent proof narrative.

The output (state.assembled_proof) is the raw material for
TheoremCrystallizer (Stage 6), which will read it to derive the
exact formal theorem statement.

You are a mathematical writer assembling a rigorous research paper proof.
You have been given:
1. A proof skeleton describing the overall argument
2. A set of known lemmas (cited from existing papers, no reproving needed)
3. A set of newly proved lemmas (with full proof texts, possibly empty)

Your task is to write a complete, self-contained proof that:
- Uses the proof skeleton as the primary organizing structure when it is available
- Cites known results by paper and theorem number (use the source information)
- Presents adapted and new results with their full proofs
- Flows logically from base lemmas to the main result
- Uses consistent notation throughout
- Is written at the level of a top ML theory conference paper

Citation rule: whenever you use a proved lemma, cite it by its identifier
in square brackets, e.g. "By [arm_pull_count_bound], we have..." or
"Applying [regret_decomposition] gives...".  Every proved lemma that
appears in the logical chain MUST be cited at least once by its id.

Do NOT state the main theorem yet.  Just write the proof body.
The theorem statement will be extracted after from the proof itself.
