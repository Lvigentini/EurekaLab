## v0.4.0 — 2026-03-27 (SQLite Storage Refactor)

### SQLite Session Database
- `SessionDB` with sessions + versions tables (WAL mode, cascading deletes)
- Version history migrated from JSON files to SQLite
- Session metadata (domain, query, status, mode, stages) stored in DB
- Auto-registered at pipeline start, updated on completion

### Consolidated Storage
- Checkpoint files moved from `sessions/<id>/` to `runs/<id>/` (one dir per session)
- `_stage_progress.json` superseded by DB-backed version tracking
- `versions/` folder replaced by SQLite `versions` table

### New CLI Commands
- `eurekalab sessions` — list all sessions in a Rich table (status, domain, stages, age)
- `eurekalab clean --older-than 30 --status failed` — prune old sessions with disk usage report
- `eurekalab housekeep --push-papers` — push unfiled papers from all sessions to Zotero

### CLI Improvements
- `history` shows session context panel (domain, query, status) before version table
- `inject` commands now show the version number created
- `checkout` shows the next available stage after restore
- `from-bib` shows a summary panel (paper count, full text count, domain)

### Stats
- 193 tests (16 new for SessionDB)
- Database: `~/.eurekalab/eurekalab.db`

---

## v0.3.0 — 2026-03-27 (Non-Linear Pipeline Redesign)

### Phase 0: Version Store
- Git-like version history for research sessions
- `BusSnapshot` serializes/deserializes full KnowledgeBus state
- `VersionStore` with commit, checkout, diff, log, head
- Auto-commit on every pipeline stage completion
- CLI commands: `history`, `diff`, `checkout`

### Phase 1: Content Tier Tracking
- Paper model extended with `content_tier` (full_text/abstract/metadata/missing), `full_text`, `local_pdf_path`, `user_notes`, `source`
- `ContentGapAnalyzer` reports content availability after survey
- Interactive gap-filling prompts user for PDF directory instead of silently degrading

### Phase 2: Bibliography Injection
- `BibLoader` parses `.bib` files via bibtexparser, matches local PDFs by arXiv ID
- `from-bib` CLI command: start research from existing bibliography
- Survey runs in "gap-fill" mode when bibliography is pre-populated

### Phase 3: Zotero Read Integration
- `ZoteroAdapter` using pyzotero (Web API): import collections, items, notes
- `from-zotero` CLI command with `ZOTERO_API_KEY`/`ZOTERO_LIBRARY_ID` config
- Extracts arXiv IDs from Zotero's `extra` field, user notes as context

### Phase 4: Draft Paper Analysis
- `DraftAnalyzer` extracts structure from LaTeX, Markdown, and PDF drafts
- Regex-based extraction: title, abstract, citations, claims (theorems/lemmas), sections, TODOs
- `from-draft` CLI command with free-text instruction

### Phase 5: Non-Linear Pipeline
- `IdeationPool` model for continuous ideation (injected ideas, emerged insights)
- `inject paper/idea/draft` CLI commands for mid-session injection
- Ideation re-entry: unincorporated ideas injected into theory prompts
- Theory-to-ideation feedback: key lemma failures captured as insights

### Phase 6: Zotero Write-Back
- `push-to-zotero` CLI command: push discovered papers, session notes, tags
- Create collections, bulk-push papers, attach child notes

### Other
- `PAPER_READER_PDF_BACKEND` setting (pdfplumber default, docling optional)
- Output naming prompt at end of session (custom filenames instead of generic)
- 177 tests (53 new)

---

## v0.2.0 — 2026-03-26

- Version store foundation (Phase 0 only)
- 26 new versioning tests

---

## 2026-03-21

### 9. `theory_review_gate` Loops Until User Approves

The theory review gate previously re-ran theory at most once. If the user rejected a second time, the pipeline proceeded to the writer anyway.

**New behavior:** The gate loops — each rejection injects feedback and re-runs the full TheoryAgent — until the user approves or `THEORY_REVIEW_MAX_RETRIES` rejections are reached (default 3, configurable in `.env`). After the limit, the pipeline continues to the writer with a warning. Each iteration shows the attempt counter `(attempt N/max)`.

**Relevant files:** `eurekalab/orchestrator/meta_orchestrator.py`, `eurekalab/config.py`

### 8. Direction Fallback Always Re-prompts on Empty Input

Empty input (plain Enter or whitespace-only) in `_handle_manual_direction` now always re-prompts. Previously, pressing Enter accepted `brief.conjecture` as a silent default in `prove` mode — easy to trigger accidentally. The conjecture is still shown as a reference but the user must type it explicitly to accept.

**Relevant file:** `eurekalab/orchestrator/meta_orchestrator.py`

### 7. Add `LEAN4_BIN` path to `.env` for elan-installed Lean

Set `LEAN4_BIN=/home/shiyuan/.elan/bin/lean` so the Lean4 verifier finds the binary installed via `elan` rather than relying on a system `lean` that may not exist.

### 6. Add `CCPROXY_PORT` to `.env` for OAuth Mode

Added `CCPROXY_PORT=8100` to `.env` so `maybe_start_ccproxy()` checks and reuses the correct port instead of defaulting to 8000 and failing.

### 5. Fix Infinite Loop on ConsistencyChecker `uncited` Severity

The `uncited` retry path in `inner_loop_yaml.py` previously set `current_spec` to only `theorem_crystallizer`. After the crystallizer ran, no `ConsistencyChecker` was invoked, so `state.status` never reached `"proved"` and the outer iteration loop re-triggered the same `uncited` branch on every iteration — a deadlock.

**Fix:** The `uncited` branch now runs `TheoremCrystallizer` inline, then immediately sets `state.status = "proved"` and `break`s out of the outer loop. This matches the spec: uncited failures mean proof logic is sound, only citation gaps need fixing, so no second consistency check is required.

**Relevant file:** `eurekalab/agents/theory/inner_loop_yaml.py`

### 4. Immediate Pause on Ctrl+C (Cancel Running LLM Call)

Previously, Ctrl+C only wrote a pause flag and the pipeline waited until the next lemma boundary to stop — potentially waiting several minutes for the current LLM call to complete.

**New behavior:** Ctrl+C (or `eurekalab pause <session-id>` from another terminal) now immediately cancels the running asyncio task, interrupting any in-flight LLM call. `inner_loop_yaml.run()` catches `asyncio.CancelledError`, saves a checkpoint containing all lemmas proved before the interrupt, then raises `ProofPausedException`. Resume picks up exactly where it left off.

**Implementation:**
- `cli.py`: replaced `_install_pause_handler` + `asyncio.run()` with `_run_with_pause_support(coro, cp)`, which uses `loop.add_signal_handler` to cancel the task on SIGINT, and a 1-second background poller to detect pause flags written by an external `eurekalab pause` process.
- `inner_loop_yaml.py`: each stage execution is wrapped in `try/except asyncio.CancelledError` — on cancellation, checkpoint is saved and `ProofPausedException` is raised.

**Relevant files:** `eurekalab/cli.py`, `eurekalab/agents/theory/inner_loop_yaml.py`

### 3. Force Human Intervention When Ideation Returns 0 Directions

Previously, in `prove` (detailed) mode, `_handle_direction_gate` silently auto-created a research direction from the user's conjecture when ideation returned 0 directions. The user was never notified and the pipeline continued without any human confirmation.

**Fix:** The silent "detailed mode" auto-creation block has been removed. `_handle_manual_direction` is now called whenever `brief.directions` is empty, regardless of `input_mode`. In `prove` mode the user's conjecture is shown as a default — pressing Enter accepts it, or the user can type a different direction.

**Relevant files:** `eurekalab/orchestrator/meta_orchestrator.py`, `tests/unit/test_direction_fallback.py`

### 2. Pause Immediately Before Next Lemma

The pause-flag check in `inner_loop_yaml.py` (`LemmaDeveloper` loop) has been moved to the **start** of each lemma iteration. Previously the check happened after a lemma completed, meaning a pause request could wait up to several minutes for the current lemma's LLM calls to finish. Now the pipeline halts before the next lemma's first LLM call.

**Relevant file:** `eurekalab/agents/theory/inner_loop_yaml.py`

### 1. ConsistencyChecker Severity-Based Retry Routing

`ConsistencyChecker` now classifies every failure with a `severity` field and the outer iteration loop in `inner_loop_yaml.py` routes retries accordingly:

| Severity | Retry path |
|---|---|
| `uncited` | `TheoremCrystallizer` only — no second check — proceed to theory review gate |
| `major` | `LemmaDeveloper → Assembler → TheoremCrystallizer → ConsistencyChecker` (one attempt; second failure escalates to `all_wrong`) |
| `all_wrong` | `ProofArchitect → LemmaDeveloper → Assembler → TheoremCrystallizer → ConsistencyChecker` |

The LLM prompt in `ConsistencyChecker` now includes severity classification instructions. If the LLM omits the field, a heuristic infers it from `uncited_lemmas` vs `issues`.

---

## 2026-03-20 (continued — PRs #23, #28, #29, #30, #31, #33)

### 8. Principled Prover Confidence Scoring

The `Prover` now replaces purely format-based heuristics with a structured LLM self-assessment block appended to every proof response.

**Prompt change:** the system prompt instructs the LLM to append a `\`\`\`json` block after the proof body:

```json
{
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "completeness": "complete|partial|sketch",
  "gaps": ["...uncertain step descriptions..."],
  "weakest_step": "...",
  "techniques_used": ["..."]
}
```

Calibration guide embedded in the prompt:

| Range | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ≥ 0.95 | Every step elementary or from a named theorem; no hand-waving |
| 0.80–0.94 | All key steps present; at most one routine calculation left implicit |
| 0.60–0.79 | Sketch correct but one non-trivial step not fully worked out |
| 0.40–0.59 | Main idea right but genuine gap flagged with `[GAP: ...]` |
| < 0.40 | Incomplete proof or possibly wrong approach |

**`_parse_proof_attempt()` pipeline (6 steps):**
1. Extract inline `[GAP: ...]` tags
2. Parse the structured JSON self-assessment block
3. Heuristic fallback if no valid block (presence of "QED", "□", "this completes")
4. Citation-integrity check: penalty −0.15 per uncited lemma ID (cap −0.30)
5. Weasel-word penalty: −0.05 per "clearly"/"obviously"/etc. (cap −0.15)
6. Strip JSON block from stored `proof_text`; extract optional Lean4 sketch

### 9. Verifier Bug Fix: Format Code Error

`Verifier._peer_review()` was raising `Unknown format code 'f' for object of type 'str'` because `settings.verifier_pass_confidence` returned a `str` via Pydantic's env-var parsing. Fixed by explicit `float()` cast before `:.2f` formatting.

### 10. pdfTeX Font Expansion Fix

`! pdfTeX error (font expansion): auto expansion is only possible with scalable fonts` caused by `microtype`'s automatic font expansion being incompatible with `lmss` (Latin Modern Sans) on TeX Live 2022. Fixed by passing `expansion=false` to `\RequirePackage[expansion=false]{microtype}` in `eureka.cls`.

### 11. Token Limit UI Sliders (Extended)

Five additional token-limit controls added to the Settings tab:

| Setting | UI label | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `MAX_TOKENS_ASSEMBLER` | Assembler | 4096 |
| `MAX_TOKENS_CRYSTALLIZER` | Crystallizer | 2500 |
| `MAX_TOKENS_ARCHITECT` | Proof architect | 3000 |
| `MAX_TOKENS_ANALYST` | Analysis stages | 1600 |
| `MAX_TOKENS_SKETCH` | Proof sketch | 600 |

`server.py`'s `_CONFIG_FIELDS` mapping updated to expose all 12 token-limit knobs to the UI.

All hardcoded `max_tokens=...` literals across theory and learning agent files replaced with `settings.max_tokens_*` references.

### 12. Human Intervention for Empty Survey

When the survey stage completes with zero papers found, the pipeline pauses and prompts the user:

```
⚠ Survey stage completed but found 0 papers.
Please provide a comma-separated list of paper IDs/titles to retry,
or press Enter to proceed without papers:
```

If the user provides titles, the survey task is re-injected with the paper list and re-executed once. Implemented in `MetaOrchestrator._handle_empty_survey_fallback()`.

### 13. ProofCheckpoint Bug Fixes (Issue #27)

| Bug | Fix |
|---|---|
| `cp.checkpoint_path` AttributeError — public property was missing | Added `@property checkpoint_path → self._checkpoint` |
| `cli.py resume` used wrong meta key `"research_brief"` (dict) | Fixed to `json.loads(meta.get("research_brief_json", "{}") or "{}")` |
| `cli.py resume` used wrong attribute `exc.paused_before_stage` | Fixed to `exc.stage_name` |

### 14. Minimax LLM Backend (PR #23)

New backend shortcut `LLM_BACKEND=minimax`:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `MINIMAX_API_KEY` | Minimax API key |
| `MINIMAX_MODEL` | Minimax model name (e.g. `abab7-chat`) |

**`active_model` / `active_fast_model` properties** added to `Config` — resolve the correct model string for any backend (Anthropic, Minimax, OpenAI-compat). All agents and theory stages updated to use `settings.active_model` / `settings.active_fast_model` instead of hardcoded model names.

### 15. PDF Extraction via Docling (PR #23)

`PaperReader._extract_from_paper_pdf()` fetches the full arXiv PDF via Docling, filters to theorem/lemma sections with a regex pass, then runs the LLM extractor over the rich excerpt instead of the abstract only.

Enable with the `[pdf]` optional extra:

```bash
pip install eurekalab[pdf]
```

### 16. Memory Relevance-Based Retrieval (PR #30)

Tier 4 domain memories are now ranked by **cosine similarity** to the current task query instead of most-recently-written ordering.

- `_index.json` now stores a `"embedding"` field per memory file (computed at write time using `embedding_utils.get_embedding()`)
- `MemoryManager.load_for_injection(domain, k, query)` accepts a `query` argument; if provided, ranks candidates by cosine similarity and returns the top-k most relevant files
- New helper module: `eurekalab/memory/embedding_utils.py` (`get_embedding()`, `cosine_similarity()`)

### 17. smile.sty Math Macro Package (PR #28)

A comprehensive SMiLe-group math macro package (`smile.sty`) is now bundled with the template:

- Blackboard bold shortcuts: `\RR`, `\EE`, `\PP`, `\NN`, `\ZZ`, `\QQ`, `\CC`, …
- Calligraphic shortcuts: `\cA` … `\cZ`
- Bold vectors (mathbf family): `\xb`, `\Wb`, … and (bm family): `\bx`, `\bW`, …
- Bold Greek: `\balpha`, `\bbeta`, `\bGamma`, …
- Norm/bracket macros: `\norm{x}`, `\nbr{x}`, `\bignorm{x}`, `\opnorm{x}{p}`

The writer agent system prompt is updated to list all available macros and instruct the LLM to use them instead of redefining equivalents.

### 18. OpenClaw Hub Integration (PR #31)

Skills can now be installed directly from the [ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai/) registry:

```bash
eurekalab install-skills <skillname>
# e.g. eurekalab install-skills steipete/github
```

`install-skills` with no argument continues to install all bundled seed skills. The `clawhub` CLI must be installed separately. The implementation lives in `eurekalab/skills/from_hub.py`.

### 19. Bug Fix: pause AttributeError (PR #33)

`cli.py` referenced `exc.paused_before_stage` but `ProofPausedException` stores the field as `stage_name`. Fixed both call sites so pausing a run no longer crashes with `AttributeError`.

### 20. Direction Planning Fallback (PR #33)

When `DivergentConvergentPlanner.diverge()` returns an empty list or throws an exception, the orchestrator now halts and prompts the user to enter a research direction manually instead of silently continuing with no direction. The survey's open problems are shown as context. Empty input or Ctrl+C raises `RuntimeError` and exits cleanly.

## 2026-03-20

### 1. Theory Review Gate

A new `theory_review_gate` orchestrator task is inserted between the TheoryAgent and WriterAgent in `default_pipeline.yaml`. It is always shown, regardless of `--gate` mode.

- Displays a numbered lemma chain (L1, L2, …) with `✓ verified` / `~ low confidence` tags.
- **y / Enter** → proceed to writer.
- **n** → user specifies the most problematic step (by number or ID) and describes the issue. The TheoryAgent re-runs once with the feedback injected into its task description, then shows the updated sketch once more.

### 2. Pause / Resume

Two new CLI commands and a graceful `SIGINT` handler:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `eurekalab pause <session_id>` | Write `pause.flag`; theory agent stops at next stage boundary and saves `checkpoint.json` |
| `eurekalab resume <session_id>` | Load checkpoint and continue from the saved stage |
| **Ctrl+C** during `prove` | Same as `pause` — writes flag instead of raising `KeyboardInterrupt` |

Checkpoint file: `~/.eurekalab/sessions/<session_id>/checkpoint.json`

### 3. ProofArchitect Improvements

- **`source=None` crash fixed:** `item.get("source") or ""` instead of `item.get("source", "")` so a JSON `null` value never passes through as `None`.
- **3-layer fallback:** full plan (4–10 lemmas) → 3-lemma simplified plan → single `main_result`. Single-goal is now truly a last resort.

### 4. Citation Quality Improvements

- **Assembler** prompt requires explicit `[lemma_id]` citations in the assembled proof (e.g., `By [arm_pull_count_bound], …`).
- **ConsistencyChecker** receives the list of proved lemma IDs and verifies all appear in the proof; returns `uncited_lemmas`.
- **Retry routing:** when ConsistencyChecker failure is citation-related ("uncited" / "missing citation"), the retry loop re-runs the Assembler as well as the Crystallizer — not just the Crystallizer.

### 5. TheoremCrystallizer Fixes

- `max_tokens` raised from 1500 → 2500 to prevent mid-expression truncation of LaTeX formulas.
- Added explicit no-truncation constraint for math environments.

### 6. Knowledge Graph Write Timing

Tier 3 KG writes now trigger whenever `proven_count > 0` (i.e., after any lemma is proved), not only when the full consistency check passes. Lemma nodes and dependency edges are preserved even when crystallization fails.

### 7. Bug Fixes

| File | Bug | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `agents/theory/inner_loop_yaml.py` | `cp.delete()` AttributeError at checkpoint clear | `cp.delete()` → `cp.clear()` |
| `agents/theory/inner_loop_yaml.py` | `ProofPausedException` swallowed by bare `except Exception` | Added `isinstance(e, ProofPausedException): raise` before handler |
| `agents/theory/agent.py` | `ProofPausedException` swallowed in agent execute | Added explicit re-raise |
| `orchestrator/meta_orchestrator.py` | `_init_brief` created a new session UUID, mismatching `pause.flag` path | `session_id` reuses `bus.session_id` |

---

## 2026-03-19

### 1. Robust Lemma Decomposer Parsing

`_parse_lemmas` in `agents/theory/decomposer.py` now uses a 4-pass extraction strategy instead of 2, preventing the "Empty lemma list from decomposer" fallback in most cases:

| Pass | Strategy |
|---|---|
| 1 | JSON inside ` ```json ``` ` or plain ` ``` ``` ` code fence |
| 2 | First JSON object `{...}` — checks 7 key names: `lemmas`, `steps`, `subgoals`, `proof_steps`, `lemma_list`, `components`, `parts` |
| 3 | First JSON array `[...]` — accepted directly as lemma list |
| 4 | Plain-text numbered/bulleted list heuristic |

`_normalize_list` accepts flexible field names per item (`id`/`lemma_id`/`name`/`title`, `statement`/`formal_statement`/`hypothesis`/`content`, etc.) so variant LLM output schemas are handled without falling back to single-theorem mode.

The same 4-pass strategy was also applied to `ProofArchitect._parse_lemmas`.

### 2. UI Polling Log Suppression

`GET /api/runs/<id> 200` status-poll requests are now logged at `DEBUG` level instead of `INFO`, removing repetitive log noise during long runs.

### 3. Bug Fixes

| File | Bug | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `agents/survey/agent.py` | `ValueError: substring not found` on unclosed ` ```json ` block | Wrapped `text.index` in try/except |
| `agents/base.py` | `run_agent_loop` ignoring `SURVEY_MAX_TURNS` setting | Uses dynamic `AsyncRetrying` now |
| `main.py` | `NameError: name 'Path' is not defined` in `save_artifacts` | Added `from pathlib import Path` |
| `ui/server.py` | `GET /api/runs/...` spamming the log | Demoted to `DEBUG` for 200 polling responses |

### 4. Always-On Stage Summary Cards

`orchestrator/gate.py` now prints a Rich summary card after every completed pipeline stage regardless of `GATE_MODE`:

| Stage | Card shows |
|---|---|
| `survey` | Papers found, open problems, key mathematical objects |
| `theory` | Proof status, per-lemma breakdown with confidence tags |
| `experiment` | Alignment score, per-lemma numerical check results |
| `writer` | Full session summary before final output |

### 5. Human Gate Improvements

- **Text feedback input:** after approving a gate, users can type a correction or hint injected into the next agent's task via `get_user_feedback()`
- **Auto-escalation:** if ≥1 lemma has `verified=False` after theory stage, gate auto-escalates from `auto` to `human` with full lemma confidence breakdown
- **Default changed:** `GATE_MODE` default changed from `none` to `auto`

### 6. Proof Readability Enforcement (WriterAgent)

`ENFORCE_PROOF_STYLE=true` (default) injects `_PROOF_STYLE_RULES` into writer prompts:
- No skip words ("clearly", "trivially", "by standard arguments") without immediate justification
- Every inequality must name the lemma or theorem it uses
- Each lemma proof opens with 1–2 sentences of informal explanation
- Low-confidence lemmas tagged `\textcolor{orange}{\textbf{[Unverified step]}}` in PDF
- Limitations section explains all unverified steps
- Added `\usepackage{xcolor}` to `LATEX_PREAMBLE`

### 7. Targeted Numerical Testing (ExperimentAgent)

ExperimentAgent now separates proven lemmas into `verified` and `low_confidence` groups:
- For each low-confidence lemma: runs dedicated numerical test, computes `violation_rate`
- Lemmas with `violation_rate > 1%` flagged as `numerically_suspect`
- Experiment stage summary card shows per-lemma check results with color coding
- WriterAgent adds stronger warnings for `numerically_suspect` lemmas

### 8. CLI Default Output Directory

All three CLI commands (`prove`, `explore`, `from-papers`) now default to `./results` if `--output` is not specified.

### 9. Bibliography & Citation Fix

Removed `\cite{}` → `?` bug in output PDFs:
- `_fix_missing_citations()` surgically removes `\cite{}` keys that have no matching entry in `references.bib`
- `LATEX_END` split into `LATEX_END_WITH_BIB` / `LATEX_END_NO_BIB` — `\bibliography{references}` only added when `.bib` is non-empty
- WriterAgent prompt instructs LLM to use exact cite keys (same as `_generate_bibtex`)

### 10. LaTeX Extraction Improvements

Extended `_extract_latex` in WriterAgent with:
- Markdown heading → LaTeX section conversion
- `tikzpicture` environment removal
- Environment name normalization additions: `rem`→`remark`, `rema`→`remark`, `prop`→`proposition`, `defin`→`definition`, `corolary`→`corollary`, `Cor`→`corollary`, `Thm`→`theorem`, `Lem`→`lemma`
- `\endproof` → `\end{proof}` substitution
- QED box removal (`\begin{flushright}$\square$\end{flushright}`)
- Two-pass `_close_open_environments`: (1) remove orphaned `\end{X}`, (2) append missing `\end{X}`

### 1. Context Compression

Optimization summary:

| Stage | Before | After | Saving |
|---|---|---|---|
| Formalizer model | `opus` | `haiku` | ~90% cost per call |
| Formalizer re-run | Every iteration | Only on change | Saves N-1 calls |
| Proven lemma context | 200-char proof text | Statement only (120) | ~40% input tokens |
| Verifier (high-conf) | Always LLM call | Auto-accept ≥ 0.85 | ~30% fewer calls |
| Verifier proof text | Raw (up to 3000 chars) | Head+tail (1000 chars) | ~67% input tokens |
| Agent loop history | Accumulates forever | Compressed every 6 turns | ~60% input tokens |
| Stagnation | Wastes 3+ iterations | Forced refinement | Saves full iterations |

**Run performance:** typical run now ~20 LLM calls (down from ~35); worst case ~55 (down from ~100).

**Agent `max_turns` reductions:**

| Agent | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| SurveyAgent | 15 | 8 |
| IdeationAgent | 5 | 3 |
| ExperimentAgent | 10 | 5 |
| WriterAgent | 5 | 3 |

**New config knobs:** `CONTEXT_COMPRESS_AFTER_TURNS`, `AUTO_VERIFY_CONFIDENCE`, `STAGNATION_WINDOW`

### 2. Configurable Token Limits Per Call Type

7 new `.env` variables:

| Variable | Default | Applies to |
|---|---|---|
| `MAX_TOKENS_AGENT` | `8192` | All agent reasoning loops |
| `MAX_TOKENS_PROVER` | `4096` | Proof generation |
| `MAX_TOKENS_PLANNER` | `4096` | Research direction planning |
| `MAX_TOKENS_DECOMPOSER` | `2048` | Lemma decomposition |
| `MAX_TOKENS_FORMALIZER` | `2048` | Formalization, refiner, counterexample |
| `MAX_TOKENS_VERIFIER` | `1024` | Proof verification |
| `MAX_TOKENS_COMPRESS` | `512` | Context compression |

UI sliders added in the Settings tab for all 7 values.

### 3. Multi-Backend LLM Support

Three named backends in `config.py` and `llm/factory.py`:

| Backend | `LLM_BACKEND=` | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Anthropic native | `anthropic` | Default |
| OpenRouter | `openrouter` | Set `OPENAI_COMPAT_API_KEY=sk-or-...` |
| Local (vLLM/Ollama) | `local` | Defaults to `http://localhost:8000/v1` |

**ccproxy / OAuth fallback:** if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is empty, automatically reads `~/.claude/.credentials.json` and routes through ccproxy (allows Claude Pro/Max users to run without a separate API key).

### 4. Additional Tuning Knobs

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `SURVEY_MAX_TURNS` | `8` | Tool-use turns in SurveyAgent |
| `THEORY_STAGE_MAX_TURNS` | `6` | Turns per theory stage |
| `WRITER_MAX_TURNS` | `4` | Turns for paper generation |
| `ARXIV_MAX_RESULTS` | `10` | Hard cap on arXiv results |
| `LLM_RETRY_ATTEMPTS` | `5` | Retry attempts on 5xx / rate-limit errors |
| `LLM_RETRY_WAIT_MIN` / `MAX` | `4` / `90` | Exponential backoff bounds |

### 5. Domain Plugin Architecture

New three-tier plugin system:

```
EurekaLab (general pipeline)
    └── DomainPlugin (e.g. MAB)
            └── Workflow (per-domain prompt guidance)
```

**New files:**
- `domains/base.py` — `DomainPlugin` ABC with 4 methods
- `domains/__init__.py` — `@register_domain` decorator + `resolve_domain()`
- `domains/mab/` — MAB domain plugin (GaussianBandit, BernoulliBandit, 4 tools, 4 skills, 3-level benchmark)

**Core changes:**
- `SkillRegistry.add_skills_dir()` — load skills from domain directories
- `build_default_registry()` — now domain-agnostic; domain tools registered via plugin
- `MetaOrchestrator` — accepts `domain_plugin` parameter
- `EurekaSession.run()` — auto-detects domain plugin from `InputSpec.domain`

### 6. LaTeX Compilation Robustness

- Added 7 `\newtheorem` declarations to `LATEX_PREAMBLE`: `assumption`, `maintheorem`, `conjecture`, `claim`, `example`, `fact`, `observation`
- Environment name normalization in `_extract_latex` (step 6): mis-cased names corrected
- `_close_open_environments()` — new static method, stack-based, prevents `\begin{tabular}` truncation from causing fatal errors
- Removed `_rescue_compile` and `paper_rescue.tex` fallback entirely
- Full bibtex-aware compile sequence: `pdflatex → bibtex → pdflatex → pdflatex`

### 7. Bibliography & Reference Resolution

- **Write order fixed:** `references.bib` saved **before** `_compile_pdf()` is called
- **bibtex added to compile sequence:** previously only `pdflatex` ran twice
- **Cite key consistency:** `_compute_cite_keys()` in WriterAgent uses identical algorithm to `_generate_bibtex` in `main.py`
- **Duplicate key handling:** `_generate_bibtex` deduplicates with `a`, `b`, … suffixes
- `ResearchOutput.bibliography_json` field added

### 8. Experiment Mode Control

New `EXPERIMENT_MODE` env var:
- `auto` — skip experiment if formal statement has no quantitative signals
- `true` — always run experiment stage
- `false` — always skip experiment stage
